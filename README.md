Hi! I am Clarity Kummer.

This GitHub is a growing, evolving space which may serve to document and showcase my technical work as a student of Statistics, formerly (B.S.) at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison and currently (M.A.) at Columbia University.

I am passionate about using Statistics and Mathematics to bring structure and insight to an otherwise arbitrary world. My curiosity is especially drawn to their applications in finance, a field that is demanding and rigorous, high-stakes, and, while I aim to prove otherwise, inherently inconsistent and unpredictable.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills

Python: PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, torchvision, PIL

R: RStudio, ggplot2, dplyr, quantmod, forecast, tseries, fGarch, fBasics

Databases: SQL


I am always open to learning, networking, and collaborating. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!

Please be mindful of how you may use this content. None of the content here (especially historic coursework) is to be used in such a way that violates academic and general integrity. Again, this page serves as a way for me to demonstrate and record my technical capacity, my growth and, perhaps, curiosity.
