# Hi, I am Clarity Kummer.

### This GitHub is a growing, evolving space that may serve to document and showcase my technical work as a student of Statistics, formerly (B.S.) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and currently (M.A.) at Columbia University.

#### I am motivated to use my passion for statistics and mathematics to bring structure and insight to an otherwise arbitrary world. I am especially drawn to applications in finance, a field that is rigorous, high-stakes, and, while I aim to prove otherwise, historically regarded as inherently unpredictable. 

# Tools & Skills

### Python:
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, torchvision, PIL

### R: 
- RStudio, ggplot2, dplyr, quantmod, forecast, tseries, fGarch, fBasics

### Databases: 
- SQL


I am always open to learning, networking, and collaborating. Please don’t hesitate to reach out!

Please be mindful of how you may use this content. None of the content here (especially historic coursework) is to be used in such a way that violates academic and general integrity. Again, this page serves as a way for me to demonstrate and record my technical capacity, growth and, perhaps, curiosity. 

## Additional Code Available Upon Request for: _Time Series Analysis_, _Finanical Statistics_, and _Deep Learning and Generative Models_
### Please reach out to ckk2129@columbia.edu
