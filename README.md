Hi, Iâ€™m Clarity ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub is a growing, evolving space which may serve to document and showcase my technical work as a student of Statistics, formerly (B.S.) at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison and currently (M.A.) at Columbia University.

I am passionate about using Statistics and Mathematics to bring structure and insight to an otherwise arbitrary world. My curiosity is especially drawn to their applications in finance, a field that is demanding and rigorous, ever-changing, high-stakes, and (debatablyâ€¦) inherintely unpredictable.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills

Python: PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib

R: RStudio, ggplot

Databases: SQL

I am always open to learning, networking, and collaborating â€” please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
