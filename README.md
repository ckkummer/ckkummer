Hi, Iâ€™m Clarity ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub is a space to document and showcase my technical work as a student of Statistics â€” formerly at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison and currently at Columbia University.

I am passionate about using Statistics and Mathematics to bring structure and insight to an otherwise arbitrary world. My curiosity is especially drawn to their applications in finance, a field that is ever-changing, high-stakes, and (debatablyâ€¦) unpredictable.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills

Python: PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib

R: RStudio, ggplot

Databases: SQL

I am always open to learning, networking, and collaborating â€” please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
